# Connor Lind's Personal Website

[Connorlind.com](http://www.connorlind.com) is a portfolio site and sandbox for my development as a full-stack Javascript engineer. I will implement new technologies here as I learn them.

This website is built on the MERN Stack, jQuery, Sass, and utilizes the Sendgrid API as an email provider.

All code is linted with the Airbnb Style Guide and annotated where necessary.

## Notable Features

* [Redux Form](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/tree/master/client/src/components/Contact) - The form framework used
* [Sendgrid API](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/routes/contactRoutes.js) - The email sent with every contact
* [Custom Webpack Config](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/tree/master/client) - Full-stack Webpack 3 configurations for development and production
* [jQuery Nav Bar](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/client/src/index.jsx) - Sticky navigation, one of jQuery's strong suits
* [Particle.js Banner](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/client/src/assets/config/particles.json) - Third-party canvas for the main banner area
