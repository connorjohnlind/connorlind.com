# Connor Lind's Personal Website

[Connorlind.com](http://www.connorlind.com) is a portfolio site and sandbox for my development as a full-stack Javascript engineer. I will implement new technologies here as I learn them.

This website is built "serverless" with Amazon Web Services.

## Notable Features

* [Redux Form](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/tree/master/client/src/components/Contact) - The form framework used
* [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/lambda/index.js) - Sends an email with SES and stores the result in DynamoDB
* [jQuery Nav Bar](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/client/src/index.jsx) - Sticky navigation, one of jQuery's strong suits
* [Particle.js Banner](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/client/src/assets/config/particles.json) - Third-party canvas for the main banner area
