# Connor Lind's Personal Website

This website is a portfolio and sandbox for my development as a full-stack javascript engineer. I will implement new technologies here as I learn them.

## Points Of Interest

The following are key areas of focus for the development of this application.

### The Gulpfile

The [gulpfile](https://github.com/connorjohnlind/connorlind.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js) is one of my key areas of focus for this application. This task manager is centered on the Node Ecosystem, and utilizes Browserify to implement all modules into production. The Gulpfile manages all of the following tasks:

* [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) -
* [Babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) -
* [Uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify) -
* [Sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass) -
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) -
* [CSS Nano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano) -
* [Sourcemaps](https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps) -
* [Imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin) -

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
