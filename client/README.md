# Connor Lind's Personal Website

[Connorlind.com](http://www.connorlind.com) is a sandbox for my development as a full-stack Javascript engineer. I will implement new technologies here as I learn them.

This website is built with ES6 Javascript, jQuery, and Sass. It is currently hosted as a static website on Amazon S3.
